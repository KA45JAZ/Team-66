      <h1>About Goodfit</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Goodfit</strong> – your go-to place for stylish and comfortable sportswear.
        We offer a curated range of activewear including hats, tees, leggings, trainers and more,
        designed to help you look good and feel confident while staying active.
      </p>

      <p>
        Selecting and designing sportswear empowers fitness enthusiasts by combining innovation
        with performance. We’re more than a sports brand; we are a community that wants to be

      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        At Goodfit, our mission is to create sports-optimised apparel that motivates individuals
        to stay active. We focus on durable, breathable fabrics and inclusive design so movement
        feels enjoyable rather than a chore. Our goal is to build a positive fitness community
        where everyone, regardless of age or fitness level, feels supported and encouraged.

            <h3>The Vision</h3>
            <p>
              We recognised that many activewear brands exist, but few are affordable for university
              students. That gap inspired Goodfit: stylish, comfortable and budget-friendly activewear.

            <p>
              We conducted market research, ordered and tested samples, and refined designs that met
              real customer needs—leading to our first Goodfit collection.
